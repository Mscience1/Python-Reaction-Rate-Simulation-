# Python-Reaction-Rate-Simulation-
Python chemistry reaction rate simulation using matplotlib and numpy. 

Define contains the basic definition of a particle. 

Define_Chem2 (Chloride and Bromine reaction) /Define_Chem(Hydrogen and Iodine reaction) contains the chemical/physical definition of a particle using Define.

Data Uses the classes defined in Define_Chem2 in order to run the simulation and output graphs. 

Anim Uses the classes defined in Define_Chem2 in order to produce a graphical simulation which can be viewed.

Full explaination of project will be added in the Coming Days!
